# VIRTUAL SHIZUOKA

## Summary

"VIRTUAL SHIZUOKA" is an initiative to collect and accumulate 3D point cloud data by surveying large areas of real-world space using laser scanners and other tools, with the goal of making this data open to the public.

This data allows for the recreation of Shizuoka Prefecture at a 1:1 scale in a virtual space, represented as a collection of points. It is anticipated to serve as a new form of social infrastructure in the era of digital twins.

Our aim is to use this data not only for urban development, infrastructure maintenance, and disaster prevention, but also for tourism, autonomous driving, entertainment, and other societal applications, to help create a better future for everyone in Shizuoka Prefecture.
